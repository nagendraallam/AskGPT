#TERMINAL CHATGPT
This is a basic terminal chatbot built in Python that is designed to handle simple interactions with the user. The chatbot is still in its early stages of development, but future versions will include the ability to extract information from previous commands to improve responses.

## Getting Started

To use the chatbot, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the `chatbot.py` file in your terminal. The chatbot will prompt you to enter a message, and you can start interacting with it by typing your message and pressing Enter.

## Future Updates

Future versions of the chatbot will include the ability to extract information from previous commands to improve responses. This will enable the chatbot to provide more personalized and accurate responses to user inquiries.
